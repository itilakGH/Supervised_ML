Analyzing loans data and applying techniques to predict high risk loans

In this project we had to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Objectives of this project:

- Implement machine learning models.
- Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

The tolls and technologies used in the project:
- csv file with loans data
- Python
- Jupyther notebook
- GitHub
